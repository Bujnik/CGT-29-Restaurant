# CodeGymTasks
 CodeGym mini projects
 
 This will not be regular business-like repository. Main branch will remain empty, rest of the branches will represent different mini-projects I'm doing in my CodeGym course.
 
 Every branch has its own version of README file that explains briefly given project.
